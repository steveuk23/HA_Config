# install the custom:swipe-card and custom:button-card from HACS#

# 1.Copy and paste everything from line 15 to 189 into Notepadd++ on a pc #
# 2.To test this out go to Homeassistant settings/helpers  #
# 3.Create a new dropdown helper and add 4 options lights,climate,media & blank and name the helper "menu_select" so you should have a new entitiy called "input_select.menu_select" #
# 4.The parts you see below like "light.YOUR_LIGHT" change to one of your entities and repeat on all of them" #
# 5.You may have to delete any line that has a Hashtag on it (they're not important anyway) #
# 6.Once you have changed everything and deleted things create a new "manual" card in home assistant and delete whats in here and copy and paste 
    and it should work with 3 cards that swipe and open different cards when clicked on. #
